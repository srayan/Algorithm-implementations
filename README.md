Algorithm-implementations
=========================

These programs simulate node-link based connectivity, used for studying computer networks.
In such cases it is important to find the shortest path between nodes, in order to communicate data efficiently.

Dijkstra's algorithm is an important corner-stone which helps calculate the shortest path between nodes.
The first program emulates it.
